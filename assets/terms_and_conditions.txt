We help Care Providers match with “Care Seekers” (individuals seeking in home care). As used herein, the terms “you” and “your” include any Care Provider who accesses the Site or the Services and, when applicable in the case of a Care Provider, any entity, such as an LLC or corporation, out of which the individual operates the individual’s Care Provider business.

The Dochome Website allows Care Seekers to contact the company in order to share the requirements for the Care Provider. The Dochome Service also provides the following features including:

Screening for licenses, insurance, background checks and references where required;
Matching technology for finding available Care Providers;
Electronic Visit Verification confirming the hours and locations worked by Care Provider;
The Dochome Mobile App allows Care Providers to review Care Seeker schedules, requirements and suggested rates. Care Providers use the mobile app to select their zip code, travel distance, required rates, and schedule preference. They also use the app to provide their license info, references, background check or any other documents required by the state in which they operate.

Limitations on the Services
Dochome will not evaluate compliance with any term or condition relating to a Care Provider’s performance of services for a Care Seeker. Dochome’s functions are in all respects ministerial and administrative on behalf of and in support of the parties to a contractual relationship created pursuant to the Site and Services.

Dochome also does not provide any medical, diagnostic, assessment, treatment or clinical service, engage in any conduct that requires a professional license, and/or that constitutes the providing of home care.
